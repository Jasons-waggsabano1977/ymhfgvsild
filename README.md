OMG, just out of the theater and my head is spinning like it's on a carousel with broken horses... Honeymoon Crasher, what did I just watch? Absolute whirlwind. The theater was packedâ€”people rustling, popcorn flying, I think I still have some bits in my hair. My back aches from those seats, but my heart... my heart is racing.

There's this scene where the main guy, whatâ€™s his name again, Ben? Yeah, Ben, is running through the airport, like one of those squirrels I saw last week that just couldnâ€™t decide which way to go. Symbol of life, maybe? But then bam, he crashes into this trolley full of suitcases, whooooosh! Luggage explosion! People laughed, but I kinda felt it, like, emotionally? You know that weird way you feel on a Thursday afternoon when your coffeeâ€™s cold.

> The hotel! That insane pastel palace where everything was like something out of a fever dream. I swear the wallpaper was moving, like swirls of ice cream when it melts in the sun, forming sticky rivers on your hand. And the staff there, dressed like they were in some vintage space opera. I couldnâ€™t stop thinking about how I really need to download the movie for Frankieâ€”can't wait for him to watch the movie so he can see that chaotic madness.

God, this dialogue... itâ€™s like they wrote it in the middle of a hurricane. One minute theyâ€™re confessing true love, next theyâ€™re debating whether llamas would wear spectacles (??). Completely lost in translation, but in a charming way, like a cat trying to play piano. Made me think of that time the radio suddenly switched to static while baking breadâ€”random, yet oddly fitting.

The sound in the room was wild. All echoey. At some point, the music was so loud, I swear I felt it in my teeth. Can music heal cavities? That'd be neat.

I can't shake off this scene with the rainâ€”completely drenched, shoes squelching like life-sized sponge cakes, and their expressions were on another level... drenched souls? My heart felt soggy with them. And oh, the endingâ€¦ like a rainbow and a train wreck had a quirky baby. I mean, there was a part where they were dancing as if gravity had loosened its grip, twirling in slow motion while my breath caught somewhere near my left lung.

Feel like I need to watch it again or maybe sit with a dictionary and decipher. Someone just texted me if I wanna grab pizza. Do I? Need to process first. Might come out thinking toppings are plot devices.
